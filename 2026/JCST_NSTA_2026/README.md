Abstract: 

Incoming STEM doctor of philosophy (Ph.D.) students undergo a major transition from undergraduate education to graduate school, where they must balance research; coursework; and, often, teaching. Ph.D. students are frequently required to serve as graduate teaching assistants (GTAs) to meet program requirements. GTA positions can begin in the first semester of graduate school, often with limited previous teaching experience or educational classwork. Teaching experience gained as a GTA is imperative to developing skills for future professorships; however, the lack of formal educational training may have long-term impacts on GTAs’ outlooks and the educational systems they work within. Through a survey, we evaluated the teaching training programs, classroom structures, and associated attitudes toward teaching of 45 students in biology and chemistry Ph.D. programs at five institutions in Pennsylvania. Findings indicate that few GTAs have formal pedagogical education, and many receive limited teaching training. Education coursework, increased feedback, and lower student-to-GTA ratios were the most requested professional support interventions by GTAs. Respondents indicated interest in departmental and/or university standardization of teaching expectations. Few GTAs were interested in a dedicated education career, but many found enjoyment in teaching or mentoring. These findings highlight the importance of teaching experiences for GTA future career aspirations.
