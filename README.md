# Publications

This repository contains code, data processing scripts, figures, and supporting materials associated with my peer-reviewed publications.

Materials are organized **by year**, with each publication contained in its own subdirectory. Each publication folder includes only the components relevant to that work (e.g., analysis scripts, visualization code, or derived datasets).


## Notes

- This repository is intended as a **record of published work**, not a general-purpose code library.
- Code may be research-grade and tailored to specific datasets or experimental designs.
- Some publications may reference external or private datasets that are not included here.

If you are looking for reusable software tools or active development projects, those are maintained in separate repositories.
